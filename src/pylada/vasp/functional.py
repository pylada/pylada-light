class Vasp(AttrBlock):
    """ Interface to VASP code.

        This interface makes it a bit easier to call VASP_ both for
        high-throughput calculations and for complex calculations involving more
        that one actual call to the program.

        The main way to use the code is as follows.

        First, one creates the actual functional:

        >>> from pylada.vasp import Vasp
        >>> functional = Vasp()

        The one sets it up, taking care that all the required pseudo-potentials
        are defined:

        >>> vasp.add_specie = 'H', '$HOME/pseudos/PAWGGA/H'
        >>> vasp.add_specie = 'C', '$HOME/pseudos/PAWGGA/C'
        >>> vasp.sigma = 0.2
        >>> vasp.prec = 'accurate'
        >>> vasp.lcharg = True

        The parameters of the functional have the same name as the tags in the
        INCAR_. The syntax is also the same, except that integers, floats, and
        booleans can be used wherever it makes sense.

        Although a fair number of parameters already exist, some are missing. It
        is possible to add them with:

        >>> vasp.add_keyword('tagname', value)

        The tagname needs not be given in capital letters. The value can be a
        string, in which case it will be printed in the INCAR_ as is, basic
        types, such as integers, floats, and booleans, or list of such types. It
        is then possible to access the new parameter as with any other:

        >>> vasp.tagname = 5
        >>> vasp.tagname
        5

        There are few special parameters with enhanced behaviors, such as
        :py:attr:`magmom`, :py:attr:`encut`, or :py:attr:`ediff_per_atom`. 
        Any parameter can be completely disabled with:

        >>> vasp.sigma = None

        In this case, SIGMA_ will simply not appear in the INCAR_. 

        The functional is then called with two or more arguments:

        >>> result = vasp(structure, 'this/directory', sigma=-1)

        The first argument is a :py:class:`pylada.crystal.Structure` instance on
        which to perform the calculation. The species in the structure should all
        have a pseudo-potential declared vias :py:attr:`add_specie`. The second
        argument is the directory where the calculations should take place. Other
        arguments, such as ``sigma`` above will change the appropriate parameter
        for the duration of the call (the call is stateless). 

        The result is an extraction object capable of grepping different
        properties from the OUTCAR. The major property is
        :py:attr:`~pylada.vasp.extract.Extract.success`. For more, please see
        :py:class:`~pylada.vasp.extract.Extract`.

        The best way to use this functional is in conjunction with the
        high-throughput interface :py:mod:`pylada.jobfolder`.

                successfull calculation already exists, in which case the
                calculations are *not* overwritten). 

            :yields: A process and/or an extraction object, as described above.
